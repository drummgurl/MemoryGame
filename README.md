# The World of Tomorrow Matching Game

Good news everyone! :rocket: 

I've created a simple matching card game created for the Front-End Nanodegree program at Udacity as a Grow with Google scholarship student. I am a **HUGE** fan of Futurama so I attempted style my game after the show. The game is very basic.  You select cards to make matches until the game ends and you find out your final stats. Give it a whirl!

## Getting Started

To start a new matching game, simply click on your first card. The cards will jiggle slightly until you flip one over. The time clock will automatically start and keep going until you've made your last match. 

There are 8 matches total. If you like, you can click the replay icon to shuffle the cards or if you get stuck! 

Once all matches are made a modal will appear telling you you've won! You will also see your final stats including time, moves and stars. You'll also have the option to play again or cancel to look at the board.
